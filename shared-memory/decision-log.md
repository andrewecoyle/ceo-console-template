## Why This Matters

**Prevents re-litigating**: Once a decision is made, it's made. This log shows the reasoning.

**Builds institutional memory**: New team members (or future AI agents) can understand the "why" behind current state.

**Enables learning**: By tracking outcomes, we see which decisions worked and which didn't.

**Maintains consistency**: Executives can reference past decisions when making recommendations.

```markdown
### 2025-11-15: Focus on CEO Console Before Product Dev Team

**Category**: Strategic / Product

**Context**:
Building out the CEO Console system. Had to decide whether to design the Product Development Team first (since it's referenced) or build the CEO Console structure first.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Build Product Dev Team First**: Get the portable team designed, then integrate into CEO Console
2. **Build CEO Console First**: Create executive structure, placeholder for dev team
3. **Build Both in Parallel**: Design both simultaneously

**Decision Made**: Build CEO Console first, placeholder for dev team

**Rationale**:
- CEO Console is the business-specific layer, more urgent to define
- Product Dev Team design requires answering questions about tech stack, team composition
- Can iterate on CEO Console immediately, dev team can wait
- Clearer mental model: business layer first, execution layer second

**Expected Outcome**:
CEO Console structure in place, ready to use for check-ins. Dev team design deferred until tech questions answered.

**Actual Outcome**:
[To be updated]

**Lessons Learned**:
[To be updated]
```
