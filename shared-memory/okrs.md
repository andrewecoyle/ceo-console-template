## How to Use OKRs

**At Quarter Start**:
- CEO sets company-level objectives
- Each executive proposes their OKRs to support company goals
- CEO approves/adjusts

**Weekly**:
- Executives update progress in their check-ins
- Flag if any KR is at risk

**Monthly**:
- Review progress and adjust tactics if needed
- Don't change the OKRs, change how you pursue them

**At Quarter End**:
- Score each Key Result (0-100%)
- Reflect on what worked and what didn't
- Set next quarter's OKRs

## OKR Best Practices

**Objectives should be**:
- Ambitious but achievable
- Qualitative and inspiring
- Time-bound (quarterly)

**Key Results should be**:
- Quantitative and measurable
- Outcome-focused (not activity-focused)
- Limited to 2-4 per objective

**Bad KR**: "Launch 10 campaigns" (activity)
**Good KR**: "Achieve 500 signups from organic channels" (outcome)

**Note to Executives**: Your work should ladder up to these OKRs. Reference them in check-ins and recommendations.
